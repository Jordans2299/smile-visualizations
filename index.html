                    The first section goes here, and may require scrolling. It will perform
                    statistical analysis on the factors of happiness. It will do the following

                    <li>This section examines the real correlation between happiness scores and
                        metrics we studied using statistical analysis. This will allow us to see what factors
                        are objectively most important--the most common markers--and will allow us to
                        see whether or not self-reported happiness contributors seem to reflect what is actually
                        making people happy.

                                The above map reveals an interesting pattern--on average, happier countries' health and

                                make far larger
                                contributions to their score than their family and generosity do. On the other hand, the

                                happiest countries' scores tend to receive larger contributions from freedom and

                                This would seem to indicate that the economy and health systems in the happiest

                                is either more available and/or has better outcomes, making it a greater contribution to
                                their score.
                                In countries with weaker health systems and weaker economies, people seem to derive more
                                of their happiness from
                                their communities, as well as more economic prosperity within communities. This makes intuitive sense--
                                citizens in which everyone generally has more may be less inclined to ask for resources or share them.

                                    The chief economic indicator of economic prosperity is GDP per Capita, or
                                    Gross National Domestic Product per Capita. This metric, according to Investopedia,
                                    is "the value of a nation's finished domestic goods and services during a specific
                                    time period."
                                    While many different factors go into calculating GDP per Capita, it is very strongly
                                    correlated with poverty levels
                                    and population resources. It comes as no surprise from The Anatomy of Happiness that
                                    GDP per capita is thus strongly correlated with happiness; however, we can't see
                                    the economic factors influencing happiness from GDP per Capita alone. So how do the
                                    factors affecting
                                    individual economies--essentially, their policies--correlate with economic
                                    prosperity?

                                The above map reveals an interesting pattern on how economic industry breakdown
                                might not necessarily correlate with happiness. Most countries' economic breakdowns
                                are focused on services, the sector of the economy that includes tourism, nursing,
                                housekeeping, and anything else that doesn't produce a "tangible" good. Indeed,
                                service actually makes up the majority of the global economy (Investopedia). However,
                                the least happy countries generally have a significant amount of their economy devoted
                                to
                                agriculture, fishing, and forestry, while the most happy countries generally
                                have a very small portion devoted to this sector. This correlation becomes much more
                                interesting when
                                its possible contribution to happiness is considered:</p>

                                    <p class="article-text"> Agriculture, fishing, and forestry are grueling work.
                                        This sector is not just associated with overuse and strain injuries, but
                                        working "in the elements" is also known to be a major cause of disease.
                                        For example, in warmer regions, farmers working with open irrigation systems can
                                        pick up schistosomiasis, a chronic parasitical infection that prefers damp
                                        environments.
